# Game Plan

This game plan is what anyone anywhere can do to begin seceding into the cloud. It would involve a simple step by step process anyone can utilize to begin weaning themselves off of dependence upon current Nation-states. It's use? It begins the movement toward bitnation and away from current structures.

Internationalizing / decentralizing assets (don't keep all your wealth in one jurisdiction / industry / currency), 
becoming anonymous (our platform will allow pseudonymous IDs so users don't need to fear government retaliation), 
and start using as many as possible crypto alternatives to the system in power (which not only includes government 
but also mercantilist corporations). I also envision a sort of global crypto insurance whose only task would be to 
protect all its customer from being detained by the government for utilizing the "black market". The moment where 
changing sides from white to black market becomes merely a matter of financial considerations, the states will 
simply die out because they lose their most affluent tax payers and lose followers as citizens chose a voluntary 
global model over geographic monopolies requiring violence to provide their services.
